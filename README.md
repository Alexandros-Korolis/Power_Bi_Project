Airlines Customer Satisfaction
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide meaningful insights into customer satisfaction. To achieve this goal, we conducted an analysis and created an interactive dashboard using the "Invistico_Airline.csv" dataset, which is available on Kaggle.com. This analysis allows us to present our findings based on specific metrics.
Analysis
Our analysis reveals that 45.27% of total customers are classified as dissatisfied. Among these dissatisfied customers, the average ratings for online support, on-board service, and in-flight entertainment are notably low, with scores of 2.96, 2.97, and 2.61, respectively. These trends are consistent across all flight classes (business, economy, and economy plus).
Additionally, when examining the average time delay, it is evident that one contributing factor to customer dissatisfaction is the high average delay times for both disloyal customers (15.75 minutes on arrival, 16.37 on departure) and loyal customers (18.72 minutes on arrival, 19.45 on departure).
Furthermore, among dissatisfied customers, the majority in all three classes (business, economy, and economy plus) are male customers.
An analysis of the age distribution among dissatisfied customers indicates that those between 22 and 28 years old tend to be more dissatisfied. In contrast, customers aged 39 to 50 and older appear to be more satisfied when using Invistico Airlines.
Conclusion
Considering the aforementioned metrics and the insights gained from dissatisfied customers, when compared to our findings regarding satisfied customers, we can conclude that to increase overall customer satisfaction, we should:
* Enhance our ratings for average online support, onboard service, and in-flight entertainment in the economy and economy plus flight classes.
* Improve average departure and arrival delay times for both loyal and disloyal customers.
This will help us in achieving higher levels of customer satisfaction.
